This Agreement may not be modified except in writing signed by both Parties hereto.

Neither Party will be in breach of the Agreement for any delay or failure to perform any obligation hereunder where the delay or failure results from any unforeseeable cause beyond its reasonable control, including epidemics, acts of God, labor disputes, or other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages, utilities or telecommunications failures, earthquakes, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war (each, a &quot; **Force Majeure Event**&quot;), so long as the Party which is totally or partially prevented from performing any of its obligations hereunder (the &quot; **Impacted Party**&quot;) takes all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event. &quot;Force Majeure Event&quot; will also mean: (i) the Covid-19 pandemic and/or its lower or derivative form (such as epidemic or viral or communicable disease outbreak) and/or national emergency or other acts, orders, or requirements of any governmental authority taken as a result or in light thereof, (ii) any other severe event which is unforeseen and not falling within the responsibility of either Party and which cannot be prevented with commercially reasonable means (such as pestilences, epidemic or pandemic) and the statutory restrictions and official orders based on such events, (iii) any evolution or downstream effect of any of the events set out in sections (i) or (ii) above, (iv) any voluntary or mandatory quarantine and/or closure and/or material limitation of use of working places or businesses, lack or material limitations of resources or inability to obtain them and other various disruptions (_e.g._, of supply chains, of transportation systems, lack or material limitations of use of labor force, non-performance of third-party suppliers, economic downturn, civil disturbances or social movements) for reasons associated with or resulting from any of the event quoted in sections (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above. The Impacted Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing and provide the other Party with its reasonable best estimate of the likely extent and duration of the Force Majeure Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such event continues for a period of thirty (30) calendar days or more, this Agreement may be terminated, upon written notice, by either Party.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute one and the same instrument. The Parties agreed that the use of facsimile reproduction of a signature by means of mechanical or other copying, electronic digital signature, or another analog of a handwritten signature is legitimate and recognizes the validity of documents signed by such means.

This Agreement will be governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

The Parties agree: (a) to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises; (b) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for binding arbitration for at least sixty (60) days; (c) that any arbitration will occur in San Mateo County, California; and (d) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association and any Expedited Procedures. The parties will select an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration; if the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be from AAA&#39;s roster of arbitrators.

If a claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted by the Parties to the arbitrator, unless a Party requests a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If a claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to AAA Rules and any expedited procedures, the arbitrator will have the ability to manage information exchange by the Parties.

The arbitrator&#39;s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot; section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a Party may be held liable.

The state or federal courts in San Mateo County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.

The Licensee will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers, employees, agents, and service providers from and against any and all damages, awards, judgments, liabilities, fines and penalties (including regulatory fines and penalties), costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees) related to or arising from any third-party claim, demand, action, or proceeding (each, a &quot; **Claim**&quot; ) that arises from or is based upon any allegation that, if true, would constitute a breach by the Licensee of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or arising from or related to: (a) Licensee&#39;s use of the Licensed Materials or ; and (b) a breach of this Agreement (including any failure by affiliates to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement).

The Company will promptly notify in writing the WANNA of the Claim (provided that failure to so notify will not remove the Licensee&#39;s obligation except to the extent it is prejudiced thereby) and reasonably cooperate with the Company in defending the Claim at the expense of the Licensee. The Licensee will have full control and authority over the defense, except that: (i) any settlement that requires the Company to admit fault, responsibility, or liability, make payments, or suffer some other adverse consequence (including any settlement that includes (1) consent to an injunction or similar relief or otherwise imposes any obligation binding upon the indemnified party and/or (2) relief other than monetary damages that the Licensee solely bears) requires express prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (ii) the Company may participate in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense.

10. **CONFIDENTIALITY**

&quot; **Confidential Information**&quot; means confidential and proprietary information, including information regarding the disclosing Party&#39;s (&quot; **Disclosing Party**&quot;) business, marketing, and/or product development plans and strategies, relationships with actual and potential customers, contractors, data, or other partners, and any other information that a reasonable business person would consider confidential or proprietary given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure (regardless of whether such information was marked or otherwise identified as confidential or with a similar legend). WANNA&#39;s Confidential Information will include any of the Licensed Materials, as well as any other information and materials relating to WANNA&#39;s collections, products, styles and designs. The Parties hereby agree that WANNA can share Licensee&#39;s Confidential Information with its subsidiaries, their officers, employees and contractors for the purposes of performance of this Agreement, each of which will be bound by confidentiality obligations of this Agreement.

The Party in receipt of the Disclosing Party&#39;s Confidential Information (the &quot; **Receiving Party**&quot;) acknowledges and agrees that, in connection with this Agreement, the Receiving Party has had, has, and/or will have access to or knowledge of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will (i) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party&#39;s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care; (ii) not use the Disclosing Party&#39;s Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose other than to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement; and (iii) not disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except: (A) to the Receiving Party&#39;s officers, employees, agents, consultants, and legal advisors (&quot;Representatives&quot;) who need to know the Confidential Information to assist the Receiving Party, or act on its behalf, to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under the Agreement, provided that such Representatives are informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the obligations of this Agreement, or (B) pursuant to applicable federal, state, or local law, regulation, or a valid order issued by a court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction, provided that the Receiving Party will first provide the Disclosing Party with: (1) prompt written notice of such requirement (unless prohibited by applicable law) so that the Disclosing Party may seek, at its sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy; and (2) reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party&#39;s sole cost and expense, in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations on disclosure.

Notwithstanding the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for any reasons whatsoever, the provisions of this Section will remain in force from the date of the Receiving Party&#39;s receipt of each item of Confidential Information until the Receiving Party destroys and/or returns each item of Confidential Information, unless each such item of Confidential Information (a) becomes public knowledge for reasons other than the breach by the Receiving Party of its confidentiality obligations provided for herein, (b) was already rightfully known to the Receiving Party as of the time it is disclosed to or obtained by the Receiving Party, (c) is subsequently learned from a third party not under a confidentiality obligation to the Disclosing Party, or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the other Party&#39;s Confidential Information.

Within thirty (30) days following termination of this Agreement for any reason, or upon reasonable request during the Term, the Receiving Party will return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party&#39;s direction, any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. If the Receiving Party is instructed to destroy the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will provide written confirmation of such destruction to the Disclosing Party, and the Receiving Party will use industry-standard techniques in order to ensure the security and completeness of such destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this provision does not apply to cases where confidential information is kept for archival or tax purposes.

11. **TERMINATION. EFFECTS OF TERMINATION**

Either Party may terminate this Agreement, without penalty or liability to such Party, immediately upon written notice thereof (i) in the event of the commencement of any liquidation, dissolution, voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding of the other Party; (ii) if the other Party is unable to pay its debts as they become due, has explicitly or implicitly suspended payment of its debts as they become due (except debts contested in good faith) or if the creditors of the other Party have taken over its management or a substantial part of its assets; (iii) if the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement and either such material breach is incapable of being remedied or continues for a period of fifteen (15) Business Days after written notice thereof, or (iv) upon ten (10) days written notice to the other Party with or without cause.

Upon termination of this Agreement, Licenseewill procure and ensure that it will promptly delete all copies of any Licensed Materials that Licensee has in its possession or under its control no later than ten (10) days following the effective date of termination.

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that, following termination of the Agreement, WANNA will not be obligated to withdraw any advertising material or press releases created by WANNA in accordance with this Agreement that display or contain any Licensed Materials and were published prior to the effective date of termination.

Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 will survive any termination of the Agreement, along with any other provisions hereof that, by their nature, are intended to survive termination.

12. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.**

WANNA IS PROVIDING LICENSEE WITH THE LICENSED MATERIALS ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WANNA AND ITS LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING ACCURACY, OPERABILITY, USE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

13. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

WANNA WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE LICENSEE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF THE LICENSEE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS. IN NO EVENT WILL WANNA&#39;S TOTAL LIABILITY TO THE LICENSEE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF ALL PAYMENTS RECEIVED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

14. **MISCELLANEOUS**

The Agreement may be assigned by the Licensee to any affiliated entity or to a successor to substantially all its business or assets by merger, reorganization, consolidation or else, upon a prior written consent of WANNA.

The Parties are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to constitute either party as an agent, representative, partner, joint venturer, or employee of the other party for any purpose.

WANNA may use a contractor (including its affiliate - WANNABY LLC, having its registration number 192982698 and registered address at Republic of Belarus, 220030, Minsk city, Kirov str. 8-40) to perform WANNA&#39;s obligations under this Agreement; provided, that WANNA&#39;s use of a contractor shall not release WANNA from any duty or liability to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable under applicable law by a court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will not be affected thereby and will continue in full force and effect. The parties also acknowledge that both were involved and represented by counsel in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement, and that, accordingly, there will be no presumption causing this Agreement to be construed against either party as the draftsman.

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all prior and contemporaneous understandings, whether oral or written, have been merged herein and are superseded hereby.

This Agreement may not be modified except in writing signed by both Parties hereto.

Any failure by WANNA to insist upon or enforce performance by Licensee of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement or otherwise by law will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any right to assert or rely upon the provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the provision, right or remedy will be and shall remain in full force and effect.

Neither Party will be in breach of the Agreement for any delay or failure to perform any obligation hereunder where the delay or failure results from any unforeseeable cause beyond its reasonable control, including epidemics, acts of God, labor disputes, or other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages, utilities or telecommunications failures, earthquakes, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war (each, a &quot; **Force Majeure Event**&quot;), so long as the Party which is totally or partially prevented from performing any of its obligations hereunder (the &quot; **Impacted Party**&quot;) takes all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event. &quot;Force Majeure Event&quot; will also mean: (i) the Covid-19 pandemic and/or its lower or derivative form (such as epidemic or viral or communicable disease outbreak) and/or national emergency or other acts, orders, or requirements of any governmental authority taken as a result or in light thereof, (ii) any other severe event which is unforeseen and not falling within the responsibility of either Party and which cannot be prevented with commercially reasonable means (such as pestilences, epidemic or pandemic) and the statutory restrictions and official orders based on such events, (iii) any evolution or downstream effect of any of the events set out in sections (i) or (ii) above, (iv) any voluntary or mandatory quarantine and/or closure and/or material limitation of use of working places or businesses, lack or material limitations of resources or inability to obtain them and other various disruptions (_e.g._, of supply chains, of transportation systems, lack or material limitations of use of labor force, non-performance of third-party suppliers, economic downturn, civil disturbances or social movements) for reasons associated with or resulting from any of the event quoted in sections (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above. The Impacted Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing and provide the other Party with its reasonable best estimate of the likely extent and duration of the Force Majeure Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such event continues for a period of thirty (30) calendar days or more, this Agreement may be terminated, upon written notice, by either Party.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute one and the same instrument. The Parties agreed that the use of facsimile reproduction of a signature by means of mechanical or other copying, electronic digital signature, or another analog of a handwritten signature is legitimate and recognizes the validity of documents signed by such means.

This Agreement will be governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

The Parties agree: (a) to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises; (b) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for binding arbitration for at least sixty (60) days; (c) that any arbitration will occur in San Mateo County, California; and (d) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association and any Expedited Procedures. The parties will select an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration; if the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be from AAA&#39;s roster of arbitrators.

If a claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted by the Parties to the arbitrator, unless a Party requests a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If a claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to AAA Rules and any expedited procedures, the arbitrator will have the ability to manage information exchange by the Parties.

The arbitrator&#39;s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot; section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a Party may be held liable.

The state or federal courts in San Mateo County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.

Other than class procedures, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
